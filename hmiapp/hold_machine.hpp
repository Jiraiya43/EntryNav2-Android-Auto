// Keeps iDrive on the app's blank state while Android Auto is on screen ("hold"), and decides when it steps aside.
//
// Android Auto is drawn in its own layer above iDrive, but the knob and the keys still act on whatever iDrive shows
// underneath. While Android Auto is on screen, iDrive must therefore sit on state 13, an inert blank state of the app,
// the way native CarPlay holds its own. Event 52 asks for it, event 51 opens the app's menu, event 50 the iDrive main
// menu (hmiapp/EntryAad.xml). What the machine does, case by case:
// - Open row, entry button: "show" and event 52 at once, not at the next status poll.
// - Android Auto comes up by itself (start automatically, phone reconnected, double MEDIA): over our menu, event 52;
//   during a call, event 52 over iDrive's call screen; over one of iDrive's own screens, where event 52 can be refused,
//   our menu first (event 51), whose focus asks for event 52 at once. After the first refused menu, our own popup
//   (below) and event 52 under it; then up to 2 more menu tries a second apart, then event 52 once.
// - A phone connects: the service keeps Android Auto aside and says so (it was told "await" when it started). Our
//   menu is asked for (event 51) once a second; its focus sends "show" and event 52, so iDrive is on our pages
//   before Android Auto shows.
// - iDrive refuses: it performs no focus event of an app while one of its own popups is the topmost one
//   (CFocusEvent::isCurrentlyAllowed in HmiMain3D: the event answers 215 and does nothing else, it is not even
//   counted). Seen on the car, opened but not started: refused for as long as no key was pressed (64 s, until
//   MENU). Nothing tells an app when that ends, and the answer itself is dropped before it reaches the app. So
//   after one refusal the app opens its own empty popup (popupEvent 53, what RHMI gives an app to come to the
//   front: iDrive lets an app's focus event through when the topmost popup is an app's), asks for the blank
//   state under it a second later, closes it and sends "show". Should iDrive refuse even that, Android Auto
//   is on screen without the hold: the touchscreen is the phone's, the knob also reaches the iDrive screen
//   underneath, and our menu is asked for once a second until it opens (event 52 then).
// - A service that did not wait (an older one) shows Android Auto by itself: the same events, then the same
//   asking without the hold.
// - BACK or tilt to our menu: event 52 at once (at most every 300 ms), and at each poll while the menu keeps the focus;
//   at most 8 events 52 until the blank state shows again.
// - Focus given back to the blank state: the hold worked, its tries start over (a focus lost and given back without
//   "visible" used them up for good, and the next BACK left the menu under Android Auto).
// - iDrive popup: the blank state stays visible but loses the focus. Android Auto steps aside for it ("popup 1", then
//   "popup 0" when it closes, hmiapp/popup_peek.hpp) however long it stays, and no event 52 is fired over it.
// - Driving mode change: iDrive keeps its own display over the blank state. Its focus loss is not fought for 15 s, then
//   event 52 every two polls without focus.
// - Hard key (MENU, MEDIA, NAV, COM, MAP, OPTION): iDrive left the blank state. Confirmed on a second poll within 3 s,
//   Android Auto steps aside ("hide"), the way MENU leaves native CarPlay; the Android Auto entry brings it back.
// - NAV, MEDIA or COM opened an Android Auto app (the service wrote its app key file within the last 2 s): iDrive
//   switched to its own screen underneath, event 52 at once so the knob does not act on that hidden screen.
// - Android Auto steps aside by itself (exit icon, signal lost) over the blank state: event 50 (iDrive main menu), or
//   event 51 when OPTION opened iDrive's option panel over it. Nothing in reverse or after a hard key.
// - Open row, but Android Auto never came up (session dropped): after 3 s on the blank state, event 51 (menu back).
// - iDrive back on the blank state by itself while Android Auto is minimized (BACK walks its history): "show", like
//   CarPlay.
// - Reverse gear: the camera wins. No popup peek, no "show", no hard key step aside, no app key hold, no event 52
//   for a lost focus.
// - Phone call: iDrive's call screen is not fought; when the call ends, event 52 within 10 s.
// - Service (re)started, or phone connected: it is told the call and the gear again (started in reverse, Android Auto
//   would come up over the camera).
//
// Pure: no BMW call, no file, no clock. Events and the time come in; iDrive events, control messages and log lines go
// out through HoldIo. Every time is in seconds since the head unit started (hmiapp/mono_clock.hpp), never the date:
// the car sets its date from the GPS, which would stretch or cut the delays below. Single-threaded (the app thread).
// tests/test_hold_machine.cpp.
